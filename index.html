      <p>Hi Parents!</p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        My name is Alek Kelly. I’m a former SVSD student and North Bend resident
        of 14 years. I started as a math tutor at Mathnasium, where I worked
        with students from kindergarten through 12th grade. I’ve been a private
        tutor since 2020, and will be making it my focus this year.

      </p>
      <p>To accomplish this, I am welcoming new students!</p>
      <p>
        Math tutoring is my primary service, but my goal is to help your student
        be successful in everything. This involves addressing foundational
        learning gaps while building up secondary skills. Your student should
        feel empowered, not overwhelmed, when tackling new challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Science (BASc) in Computing and Software
        Development from LW Tech. My work as an IT Lab Technician contracted to
        Microsoft equipped me with excellent problem-solving and analytical
        skills. I currently work at Trader Joe’s in Issaquah, where I organize
        and feature new products in the store. Outside of work, I’m an active
        member in the local running community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we begin, I’d love to connect with you to understand your goals
        and your student’s needs. Let’s schedule a time to chat!
      </p>
