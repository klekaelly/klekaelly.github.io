      <p class="intro-text">
        Hi Parents! <br /><br />
        My name is Alek Kelly. I’m a former SVSD student and North Bend resident
        of 14 years. I started as a math tutor at Mathnasium, where I worked
        with students from kindergarten through 12th grade. I’ve been a private
        tutor since 2020, and will be making it my focus this year.

      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this, I am welcoming new students! <br />
        <br />Math tutoring is my primary service, but my goal is to help your
        student be successful in everything. This involves addressing
        foundational learning gaps while building up secondary skills. Your
        student should feel empowered, not overwhelmed, when tackling new
        challenges. <br /><br />I hold a Bachelor of Science (BASc) in Computing
        and Software Development from LW Tech. My work as an IT Lab Technician
        contracted to Microsoft equipped me with excellent problem-solving and
        analytical skills. I currently work at Trader Joe’s in Issaquah, where I
        organize and feature new products in the store. Outside of work, I’m an
        active member in the local running community. <br /><br />Before we
        begin, I’d love to connect with you to understand your goals and your
        student’s needs. Let’s schedule a time to chat!
